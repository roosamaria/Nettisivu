          I have been programming since the start of my studies at TAMK in 2017.
          Starting with Java and some basic HTML &amp; CSS. I moved on to C# and
          Unity when I was assigned to the game development path. I've been
          developing with C# for over two years now, learning new and better
          ways to implement features through practical experience and reflecting
          eachothers work with other developers.

          All of my released projects that I have listed below, have been made
          in an international team and thus I have gotten good experience in
          working with people who don't share the same native language. The
          language wall can easily break communication inside the team f.ex.
          when people are misunderstood or when someone doesn't want to share
          their opinion because they feel that they can't articulate their
          opinion properly. Articulating in another language can be hard but
          when communicating inside the team, you shouldn't worry so much about
          articulating that you decide to keep your opinion to yourself.

          Recently I've been getting into web development. I started with
          relearning HTML and CSS, moving on to JavaScript and now I've been
          doing React. It has been an experience to change from C# to JS but
          I've been improving daily and plan to improve myself in this field
          further.
